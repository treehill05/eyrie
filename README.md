A project built to monitor high-density gatherings in real-time, detect dangerous crowd formations, and predict deadly crowd crush events before they occur using AI-powered drones.
Overview
Eyrie automatically streams live video from drones, detects people using YOLOv8, calculates spatial density, and generates predictive alerts.
It helps authorities prevent crowd crush tragedies by providing critical minutes to respond before disaster strikes.

Features

Multi-Source Streaming ‚Äì WebRTC video from drones or cameras with real-time person detection overlays
YOLOv8 Detection ‚Äì Uses pre-trained or custom models to detect and track individuals with bounding boxes
Spatial Analytics ‚Äì Computes crowd density using Gaussian kernel algorithms with normalized coordinates
Predictive Alerts ‚Äì Machine learning algorithms identify high-risk formations before crush events occur
Live Visualization ‚Äì Interactive overlays with tracking points, risk heatmaps, and time-series analytics graphs
Scalable Architecture ‚Äì Supports multiple simultaneous drone feeds with shared video processing
